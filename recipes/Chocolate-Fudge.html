    <h2>Chocolate Fudge - The Non-dairy way</h2>
    <p>Peri Peri sauce is just not "the everyday" condiment, use it as a marinade, 
        a dressing, a dipping sauce or a basting sauce. Best enjoyed with friends.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Â½ cup cacao power</li>
        <li>1 cup dates - pitted</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla - powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the dates in water and allow to soften (use warm water to speed up this process)</li>
        <li>Add everything together in a food processor and process until completely smooth and mixed. 
            This takes up to 20 minutes, and is well worth spending the time on this part.</li>
        <li>Pour into a shallow dish and allow it to set in the fridge. After about 3-4 hours, cut into squares.</li>
    </ol>
